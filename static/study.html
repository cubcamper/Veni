<!--In CLass-->
        <h4>Start in the classroom.</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Start by reading the assignment before the lecture. Sit where you can see the presentation and hear the the professor/teacher. Schedule your study time by writing down everything you need to do and allotting adequate amounts of time to complete the test.</li>
                <li>Attend all classes/lectures. Write lecture notes in class and rewrite/review them when you get home to help you remember them. Make sure to write neatly sometimes you will not have time to rewrite the notes. Highlight               with discretion while reviewing your notes.</li>
                <li>Ask questions if you are confused with a concept, make sure to identify the exact step where you get confused. </li>
            <li>Make sure to write information down even if you think that you are going to remember the information. 
            </ul>

        <h4>Stay organized!</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand the importance of time management. Take advantage of our Pomodoro timing system!</li>
                <li>Make sure to have a organized study place. Make sure to identify what type of learner you are (and study appropriately). Make sure to actively read when going through gm
Make sure to meditate daily.</li>
            <li>If you feel like you are not aware of where all the time is going, then with a watch, pencil and piece of paper record what you are doing throughout the course of the day and how much time you spend for each activity.</li>
            <li>Plan the things you need to do tomorrow before going to sleep. Make a weekly to-do list followed by a to-do list everyday. Assign each tak an estimated amount of time that it'll time to complete the assignment. Study after you have scheduled all of your obligations. Make sure to sleep at-least 7 hours a day, sleep is the time when the brain makes/rewires neural connections. If have not been getting adequate amounts of sleep before a major test, sleep at-least 8 hours for the two days leading up to the major test. Make sure to eat something the day of the test (don't eat too much, and make sure not to change your diet on the day of the test).</li>
            </ul>
            
        <h4>And everything else. </h4>    
            <ul>
                <li>Complete and turn in all homework on time. Find a place that is free of distractions 
Study everyday (make it a habit). Work on major projects every day, set deadlines ahead of the actual deadline. Finish homework as soon as possible, homework is meant as a tool to measure oneâ€™s understanding of the concept.</li>
                <li>Sometimes it can be difficult to steer clear of distractions so applications that block distraction websites help. Some include Stayfocused (Chrome Webstore), Strict Workflow (Chrome Webstore),  Self Control (Macintosh), Take Control (Windows)</li>
                <li>The best way to learn something is by teaching it, if you cant explain the concept in terms that a six grader would understand it then you do not understand the concept. Another great way to learn things is by making associations of what you are trying to learn with what you already know.<</li>
                <li>Make sure to exercise, exercise release various endorphins that ameliorates the mood and can aid with stress</li>
                <li>Wake and sleep early: there are less distractions in the morning.</li>
            </ul>
